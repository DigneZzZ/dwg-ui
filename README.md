# Upstream DNS-Servers
### About default DNS
  The unencrypted 1.1.1.1 is fine if you're sure the connection between your AGH instance and Cloudflare DNS won't be tampered. Otherwise use the encrypted endpoint, either https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query for unfiltered query or https://security.cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query for malware filtering. Note that ECH doesn't work if you're using unencrypted upstream.
